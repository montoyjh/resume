abstract = {Auxetics comprise a rare family of materials that manifest negative Poisson's ratio, which causes an expansion instead of contraction under tension. Most known homogeneously auxetic materials are porous foams or artificial macrostructures and there are few examples of inorganic materials that exhibit this behavior as polycrystalline solids. It is now possible to accelerate the discovery of materials with target properties, such as auxetics, using high-throughput computations, open databases, and efficient search algorithms. Candidates exhibiting features correlating with auxetic behavior were chosen from the set of more than 67 000 materials in the Materials Project database. Poisson's ratios were derived from the calculated elastic tensor of each material in this reduced set of compounds. We report that this strategy results in the prediction of three previously unidentified homogeneously auxetic materials as well as a number of compounds with a near-zero homogeneous Poisson's ratio, which are here denoted “anepirretic materials”.},

abstract = {We introduce atomate, an open-source Python framework for computational materials science simulation, analysis, and design with an emphasis on automation and extensibility. Built on top of open source Python packages already in use by the materials community such as pymatgen, FireWorks, and custodian, atomate provides well-tested workflow templates to compute various materials properties such as electronic bandstructure, elastic properties, and piezoelectric, dielectric, and ferroelectric properties. Atomate also enables the computational characterization of materials by providing workflows that calculate X-ray absorption (XAS), Electron energy loss (EELS) and Raman spectra. One of the major features of atomate is that it provides both fully functional workflows as well as reusable components that enable one to compose complex materials science workflows that use a diverse set of computational tools. Additionally, atomate creates output databases that organize the results from individual calculations and contains a builder framework that creates summary reports for each computed material based on multiple simulations.},

abstract = {In the future, industrial CO 2 electroreduction using renewable energy sources could be a sustainable means to convert CO 2 and water into commodity chemicals at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This study focuses on the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 on polycrystalline Au surfaces, which have high activity and selectivity for CO evolution. We explore the catalytic behavior of polycrystalline Au surfaces by coupling potentiostatic CO 2 electrolysis experiments in an aqueous bicarbonate solution with high sensitivity product detection methods. We observed the production of methanol, in addition to detecting the known products of CO 2 electroreduction on Au: CO, H 2 and formate. We suggest a mechanism that explains Au's evolution of methanol. Specifically, the Au surface does not favor C–O scission, and thus is more selective towards methanol than methane. These insights could aid in the design of electrocatalysts that are selective for CO 2 electroreduction to oxygenates over hydrocarbons.},

Using open-source computational tools from the Materials Project infrastructure, we automate the procedure of constructing symmetrically distinct adsorbate configurations for arbitrary slabs. These algorithms are further used to construct and run workflows in a standard, automated way such that user intervention in the simulation procedure is minimal. To validate our approach, we compare results from our workflow to previous experimental and theoretical benchmarks from the CE27 database of chemisorption energies on solid surfaces. These benchmarks also illustrate how the task of performing and managing over 200 individual density functional theory calculations may be reduced to a single submission procedure and subsequent analysis. By enabling more efficient high-throughput computations of adsorption energies, these tools will accelerate theory-guided discovery of advanced materials for applications in catalysis and surface science.},

abstract = {We present a DFT study on the effect of coverage, strain, and electric field on CO-CO coupling energetics on Cu (100), (111), and (211). Our calculations indicate that CO-CO coupling is facile on all three facets in the presence of a cation-induced electric field in the Helmholtz plane, with the lowest barrier on Cu(100). The CO dimerization pathway is therefore expected to play a role in C2 formation at potentials negative of the Cu potential of zero charge, corresponding to CO2/CO reduction conditions at high pH. Both increased *CO coverage and tensile strain further improve C-C coupling energetics on Cu (111) and (211). Since CO dimerization is facile on all 3 Cu facets, subsequent surface hydrogenation steps may also play an important role in determining the overall activity towards C2 products. Adsorption of *CO, *H, and *OH on the 3 facets were investigated with a Pourbaix analysis. The (211) facet has the largest propensity to co-adsorb *CO and *H, which would favor surface hydrogenation following CO dimerization.},

abstract = {Electroless deposition has been used to prepare Cu–Pd/SiO2 bimetallic catalysts wherein initial Cu coverages are limited only to the preexisting Pd surface. Cu loading on the Pd surface can be systematically varied by modification of deposition kinetic parameters. In this case deposition time was used as the kinetic variable for the preparation of a series of Cu–Pd catalysts. These materials have been characterized using atomic absorption, CO chemisorption, and FT-IR (adsorption of CO), and then evaluated for the hydrogenation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene, a functionalized olefin having many potential reaction pathways. Catalyst performance and characterization results suggest that Cu is not distributed in a monodisperse manner on the Pd surface, indicating the existence of autocatalytic deposition of Cu on Cu sites. The FT-IR results suggest that although CO adsorption on all sites is suppressed by Cu addition, initial Cu deposition occurs more readily on certain sites. The bimetallic Cu–Pd sites that are formed exhibit unusually high activity for EpB conversion and formation of unsaturated alcohols and aldehydes. This bimetallic effect on catalyst activity and selectivity is best explained, not by the existence of either ligand or ensemble effects, but rather by the bifunctional nature of the Cu–Pd sites present on the surface of these catalysts.},

In this work, we present insights from DFT calculations that describe limitations on the low-temperature electrocatalytic production of NH3 from N2 . In particular, we highlight the linear scaling relations of the adsorption energies of intermediates that can be used to model the overpotential requirements in this process. By using a two-variable description of the theoretical overpotential, we identify fundamental limitations on N2 reduction analogous to those present in processes such as oxygen evolution. Using these trends, we propose new strategies for catalyst design that may help guide the search for an electrocatalyst that can achieve selective N2 reduction.},

Without this charged water layer at the metal surface, the formation of the CO dimer is prohibitively endergonic. Our calculations also demonstrate that dimerization should have a lower activation barrier on Cu(100) than Cu(111), which, along with a more exergonic adsorption energy and a corresponding higher coverage of *CO, is consistent with experimental observations that Cu(100) has a high activity for C?C coupling at low overpotentials.

The results of our nudged elastic band calculations demonstrate that kinetic barriers to CC coupling decrease significantly with the degree of hydrogenation of reacting adsorbates. We also show that this trend is not affected by the electrical fields present at the solid-electrolyte interface during electrocatalysis. Our results explain how copper can catalyze the production of higher hydrocarbons and oxygenates in the electrochemical environment, despite producing only single carbon atom products in gas-phase catalysis, and how CC bonds can be formed at room temperature in the electrochemical environment, whereas substantially higher temperatures are needed in the Fischer–Tropsch catalysis. The unique feature of the electrochemical environment is that the chemical potential of hydrogen (electrons and protons) can be varied through the applied potential. This allows a variation of the degree of hydrogenation of the reactants and thus the activation barrier for CC coupling.},
