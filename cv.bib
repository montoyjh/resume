abstract = {In this work, we present DFT simulations that demonstrate the ability of Cu to catalyze CO dimerization in CO2 and CO electroreduction. We describe a previously unreported CO dimer configuration that is uniquely stabilized by a charged water layer on both Cu(111) and Cu(100). Without this charged water layer at the metal surface, the formation of the CO dimer is prohibitively endergonic. Our calculations also demonstrate that dimerization should have a lower activation barrier on Cu(100) than Cu(111), which, along with a more exergonic adsorption energy and a corresponding higher coverage of *CO, is consistent with experimental observations that Cu(100) has a high activity for C?C coupling at low overpotentials. We also demonstrate that this effect is present with cations other than H+, a finding that is consistent with the experimentally observed pH independence of C2 formation on Cu.},

abstract = {The electrochemical production of NH3 under ambient conditions represents an attractive prospect for sustainable agriculture, but electrocatalysts that selectively reduce N2 to NH3 remain elusive. In this work, we present insights from DFT calculations that describe limitations on the low-temperature electrocatalytic production of NH3 from N2 . In particular, we highlight the linear scaling relations of the adsorption energies of intermediates that can be used to model the overpotential requirements in this process. By using a two-variable description of the theoretical overpotential, we identify fundamental limitations on N2 reduction analogous to those present in processes such as oxygen evolution. Using these trends, we propose new strategies for catalyst design that may help guide the search for an electrocatalyst that can achieve selective N2 reduction.},

abstract = {In this work, we present first-principles calculations describing the catalytic activity for of a set of photoelectrocatalysts identified as candidates for total water splitting in a previous screening study for bulk stability and bandgap. Our Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of the intermediate energetics for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution suggest that none of the proposed materials has the ideal combination of bandgap and surface chemical properties that should allow for total water splitting in a single material. This result suggests that co-catalysts are necessary to overcome the kinetic limitations of the both reactions, although some materials may catalyze one half-reaction, as has been observed in experiment.},

abstract = {We present a first-principles theoretical study of carbon–carbon coupling in CO2 electroreduction on the copper 2 1 1 surface. Using DFT, we have determined kinetic barriers to the formation of a CC bond between adsorbates derived from CO. The results of our nudged elastic band calculations demonstrate that kinetic barriers to CC coupling decrease significantly with the degree of hydrogenation of reacting adsorbates. We also show that this trend is not affected by the electrical fields present at the solid-electrolyte interface during electrocatalysis. Our results explain how copper can catalyze the production of higher hydrocarbons and oxygenates in the electrochemical environment, despite producing only single carbon atom products in gas-phase catalysis, and how CC bonds can be formed at room temperature in the electrochemical environment, whereas substantially higher temperatures are needed in the Fischer–Tropsch catalysis. The unique feature of the electrochemical environment is that the chemical potential of hydrogen (electrons and protons) can be varied through the applied potential. This allows a variation of the degree of hydrogenation of the reactants and thus the activation barrier for CC coupling.},

@article{Sandberg2016,
abstract = {We present a DFT study on the effect of coverage, strain, and electric field on CO-CO coupling energetics on Cu (100), (111), and (211). Our calculations indicate that CO-CO coupling is facile on all three facets in the presence of a cation-induced electric field in the Helmholtz plane, with the lowest barrier on Cu(100). The CO dimerization pathway is therefore expected to play a role in C2 formation at potentials negative of the Cu potential of zero charge, corresponding to CO2/CO reduction conditions at high pH. Both increased *CO coverage and tensile strain further improve C-C coupling energetics on Cu (111) and (211). Since CO dimerization is facile on all 3 Cu facets, subsequent surface hydrogenation steps may also play an important role in determining the overall activity towards C2 products. Adsorption of *CO, *H, and *OH on the 3 facets were investigated with a Pourbaix analysis. The (211) facet has the largest propensity to co-adsorb *CO and *H, which would favor surface hydrogenation following CO dimerization.},

@article{Schaal2007,
abstract = {Electroless deposition has been used to prepare Cu–Pd/SiO2 bimetallic catalysts wherein initial Cu coverages are limited only to the preexisting Pd surface. Cu loading on the Pd surface can be systematically varied by modification of deposition kinetic parameters. In this case deposition time was used as the kinetic variable for the preparation of a series of Cu–Pd catalysts. These materials have been characterized using atomic absorption, CO chemisorption, and FT-IR (adsorption of CO), and then evaluated for the hydrogenation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene, a functionalized olefin having many potential reaction pathways. Catalyst performance and characterization results suggest that Cu is not distributed in a monodisperse manner on the Pd surface, indicating the existence of autocatalytic deposition of Cu on Cu sites. The FT-IR results suggest that although CO adsorption on all sites is suppressed by Cu addition, initial Cu deposition occurs more readily on certain sites. The bimetallic Cu–Pd sites that are formed exhibit unusually high activity for EpB conversion and formation of unsaturated alcohols and aldehydes. This bimetallic effect on catalyst activity and selectivity is best explained, not by the existence of either ligand or ensemble effects, but rather by the bifunctional nature of the Cu–Pd sites present on the surface of these catalysts.},
